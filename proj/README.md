# Project Source Codes

<p align="justify"> Each of the sub-directories here holds the source codes for various experiments. Each of them have been described in detail individually. Brief description of each of them are: 
 </p>
 
 - example_renode, Renode examples to test the software stack. 
 - baseline, The software baseline codes by modification of TFLite Kernels. 
 - accel, The Hardware Accelerator built using verilog and integrated with the CPU. 

<p align="justify"> All of the codes have been tested using a software stack which contains the test_images, TFLite models. Three test images have been used, further of them could be added in a similar format. 
  Three models have been provided with varying sizes, all of them have been made available. The software stack could be accessed below. The required model is to be named according to the current used model. </p>
